# Introduction 
This is my first project using SDL so it might be written badly. I'm still actively working on it trying to improve it.  
The game is currently in a very raw state and only has some features, but it'll be completed over time.

# Compiling and running the game
To compile use mingw gcc. If you intend to play in full screen set the monitor resolution to 1920x1080. After compiling go to the build folder and open the .exe

# Issues and feature requests
If you encounter any problems with the game in its current state, or if there are particular features you would like to see added, please open an issue. I will address it as quickly as possible.
